# Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is focused on analyzing diversity and inclusion (D&I) metrics within an organization. It examines workforce demographics and key diversity indicators to provide insights on gender representation, ethnicity distribution, and other important D&I factors. The analysis aims to support inclusive decision-making and track progress toward diversity goals.

## Objective
The main objectives of this analysis are to:
- Evaluate the current state of diversity within the organization.
- Identify gaps in gender and ethnic representation.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to foster a more inclusive workplace.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**: Used for data cleaning and initial exploration.
- **Power BI**: For interactive visualizations and dashboard creation.
- **SQL**: For querying the database to extract relevant D&I metrics.

## Key Metrics Analyzed
1. **Gender Representation**: Percentage of male, female, and non-binary employees.
2. **Ethnicity Distribution**: Breakdown of employees by ethnicity.
3. **Leadership Diversity**: Representation of diverse groups in managerial and executive roles.
4. **Employee Tenure by Demographics**: Length of employment categorized by gender and ethnicity.

## Insights & Recommendations
- **Underrepresentation in Leadership**: Women and minority groups are underrepresented in leadership roles, signaling the need for targeted leadership development programs.
- **High Turnover in Certain Demographics**: Identified higher turnover rates among minority groups, suggesting the need for initiatives aimed at improving retention and engagement.
- **Inclusive Hiring Practices**: Suggested revising recruitment practices to increase diversity in hiring pipelines.

## Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard includes the following:
- **Gender and ethnicity distribution across different departments**.
- **Diversity in leadership positions over time**.
- **Representation by tenure and career level**.
- **Year-over-year trends in hiring and attrition rates for diverse groups**.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satyam18g/diversity-and-inclusion-analysis.git
   ```
2. Run the Python scripts for data preprocessing and analysis.
3. Open the Power BI file to explore the diversity and inclusion insights through interactive visualizations.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporating survey data on employee experiences related to inclusion and workplace culture.
- Expanding the analysis to include geographical and generational diversity metrics.
